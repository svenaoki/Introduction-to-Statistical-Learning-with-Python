Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R might be one of the better introductory books to statistical learning and great to apply the concepts. The code to the examples are written in R as the book title suggests.
While I was on one of my longer commuter journeys from Cambridge to London, I thought it might be useful to at least translate the examples into Python. Since the code was written in the London tube and trains from the last century, I apologize for any errors or missing labels that I forgotten to include.

Anyway, each .py file follows along each chapter of the book and because I encourage interested people to buy the book, I did not include any more information other than code snippets and images. The python libraries that are used throughout the book are numpy, pandas, scipy, statsmodels and sklearn as well as matplotlib and seaborn for visualisation.
